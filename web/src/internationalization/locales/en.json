    "FAQ": {
        "Question1": "What is a subscription car?",
        "Answer1": "Subscription is the future of auto retail. Regular monthly payments gets you your own car with insurance, technical service and legal support. Subscription is a new smart way to have a car.",
        "Question2": "How is Drivovo different from a loan?",      
        "Answer2": "When you get a loan, you buy only money and inconvenience along with hidden fees. Drivovo calculates the cost of owning a car in terms of month, year, three years and it is more profitable than loan. The bank is not responsible for the operation of your car, and sells only money, you are not their priority afterwards. Drivovo provides convenient service throughout the whole subscription time. With the bank in case of an accident, all the hassles fall on you, and the insurance pay-out is expected to be made within next 4 months.Drivovo starts repairs without waiting for the insurance to be paid, but immediately upon receipt of defects and spare parts list.",
        "Question3": "How is Drivovo different from regular rental?",
        "Answer3": "Usually cars used for rent are aged 2-5 years; \nDrivovo are new cars without mileage; \nTo rent, you choose from what is in the fleet; \nIn Drivovo we select cars according to your wishes: color, equipment, model; \nWhen renting, you cannot buy a car and keep it for yourself; \nWith Drivovo in 2-3 years the car can pass into your possession with re-registration onto your name. \nFor example, you rented a car for a year for $1,500 per month. When you return the car, all your payments have covered car rental only. \nIn our service the subscription fee includes the cost of the car, and at the end of the term you will have the right of redemption, subject to payment of the residual value.",
        "Question4": "The monthly subscription includes all operating costs:",
        "Answer4": "● Pension fund and registration fees \n● CASCO 3 years (0% deductible for car accident, 5% deductible for car theft) \n● MTPL cover - 3 years \n● Luxury tax (if payable) \n● MOT for 3 years - 90,000 km \n● Winter and summer tire set \n● Tire service - storage, tire fitting, for 3 years \n● The driver who will do maintenance and tire fitting of your car \n● Option to change cars to a higher or lower class with no extra expenses \n\n<strong>You have only three commitments to us:</strong> \n1. Enjoy the ride and service every day. \n2. Pay your subscription on time once a month. \n3. Recommend our service to friends and receive bonuses for it.",
        "Question5":"What is the cost of owning a car? How is it calculated?",
        "Answer5":"Cost of ownership = price of the car + worth of the loan (if the car is bought with attraction of credit funds) + all expenses during operation - the residual value. So, you get cost of ownership for 36, 12 or 1 month. \nWhen calculating the cost of the subscription and comparing it with the purchase of a car for cash or on credit, we take into account the following costs: \n1. The cost of cars in salon. \n2. Payment to the Pension Fund. \n3. Luxury tax, if any. \n4. Registration in IRED (Interdistrict Registration and Examination Department). \n5. CASCO for 3 years. \n6. MTPL cover for 3 years. \n7. MOT based on the mileage of 30,000 km per year, for 3 years (done on the basis of maintenance maps of MOT stations for given car brand). \n8. Set of seasonal tires. \n9. Tire fitting for 3 years (6 times). \n10. Tire storage. \nThe cost of equity is the value of money you spend paying the car out in full. That is, instead of buying a car your money could generate you a profit (real estate, business, shares, trading operations). We consider the conservative value of money, which is provided, for example, by real estate investment at 7% per annum",
        "Question6": "What is the subscription signing process?",
        "Answer6": "1. Choose a car.\n2. We coordinate the calculation of the cost of the service with comparative analysis of purchase and credit. \n3. Take a personal scoring and test drive. \n4. Sign the subscription (contract, invoice). \n5. We pass the keys to the new car. \nDeal completion time - from 20 minutes.",
        "Question7": "Can I unsubscribe before the end of my subscription term?",
        "Answer7": "You can. We simply withhold the amount of the guaranteed deposit. Alternatively, you can bring a client instead of you - we will return the deposit in full. We are the first company in Ukraine that actually does not have penalties.",
        "Question8": "What is the form of subscription payment?",
        "Answer8":"Form of payment: non-cash payment. Payment is made to the company's current account in national currency. Since we are loyal to our customers, exceptions are possible.",
        "Question9":"Can I pay for several months in advance?",

        "Question10":"In what currency will I pay?",

        "Question13":"What is my risk?",
        "Answer13":"Your risk is minimized and there are no extra fees as when buying a car for cash. All you can lose is the warranty deposit, in case of violation of subscription’s terms and conditions.",
        "Question14":"Can I make the first payment more, for example, 50% of the cost of the car to reduce the monthly payment?",
        "Answer14":"You can, but what for? :)",
        "Question15":"Is it possible to pay the car out earlier, for example, in 2 years?",
        "Answer15":"It is possible, but we sell service, not cars. If you do not see value in it, it is better to take a loan instead.",
        "Question16":"Can I change the car for another one in a year?",
        "Answer16":"Easy! You return the current car and we provide you with a new one of your choice. Meanwhile, if you help us find a client whilst returning your car, the entire warranty deposit will be transferred to your new car without any losses. If we look for a new client by ourselves, we will charge you one monthly subscription payment.",

        "Answer20":"After choosing the complete set and obtaining the cost of the car, we calculate the cost of subscription.\nNext, we conduct a scoring for social capital.

        "Text3": "About three years ago, a colleague told me that there is a car subscription service in the world, I thought back then that this was the ideal option: something in between a loan and a rental. And now, it turns out, it appeared in Ukraine) The company is young, but I see an advantage in this: they can afford a very cool client approach. I saw that they just have a Peugeot 2008, which I practically decided on, left an application, they sent me a calculation, signed up for a test drive, for which a special thank you: I was given the opportunity to make 100% sure that the car suits me, they gave me a ride on a similar one. other manufacturer for comparison. Now I even think that if I was after her in a dealership showroom, I might not have bought it: you have to pay a decent amount, get a loan (or part with even larger amount), for this you need to be absolutely sure that the car is \"mine\", otherwise the risks are very high, not to mention the queue of six months or more for production (and at the Peugeot warehouses now only those configurations that no one takes). Here, I know that worst case scenario, I will lose the deposit in 2 months of the subscription (and that is, there are  options to avoid that), but if life circumstances suddenly turn out to be such that I need a car of a different class / size, this is possible hassle free as well as the sale and a purchase of new one. An additional bonus of the service is in the development of financial literacy) when calculating, they show the cost of ownership, the cost of money spent now instead of investing. The car was delivered at the time and place I suggested, washed, refuelled and with a bunch of gifts, which is especially nice. Thanks to Maxim and Oksana, I wish you the rapid development of the service!",

We agreed with Drivovo on a test drive of Tiga, but it turned out that \"at the same time\" I had the opportunity to test a hybrid Ravchik (also checked him out once before, but without enthusiasm). The first was Ravchik, and he was much more dynamic than Ive I thought) say, not as nimble as I would like, but really exceeded my expectations. And then there was Tig, and behind the wheel he naturally tore off my roof 😂 wheelbarrow - razor, I was delighted with the dynamics. We even made a few visits to “polish” my positive impressions) I didn't want to leave him at all.

        "Text6": "Why Drivovo? Because it is convenient! I was already looking out for a new car when I saw a Drivovo ad on FB. Honestly, the program did not inspire confidence at first. \"Not in this country\" - I thought. But I decided to give the situation a chance and made a request. Soon Max Soloviev called me back, and we talked for more than an hour. He explained in detail how it works and shared his plans for the future. At this stage, trust appeared not in the program, but in Max, as a CEO - I would love to work with him. Therefore, I went further, and we decided on a complete set. Max calculated the cost and listed everything in detail. Of course, I double checked everything and made sure that the prices were \"real\" and I wouldn’t have to pay for air in pretty packaging. As next stage, I  had to sell my car to make the first subscription payment. And then I realized what a \"personal approach\" is. Max took my Mazda and went to the dealership for an appraisal himself, leaving his Audi as a pledge. This greatly strengthened my confidence in him, and saved me a lot of time and energy. To sign the contract, Max came to my house with his son and gave him a packet of $$$ to count. After that, I no longer doubted that I was doing everything wright. My special set arrived pretty quickly. A week before the deadline, Max said that the car was already ready, and with numberplates. It was a pleasant surprise for me. Test drives from Drivovo are a separate fascinating story that requires its own post. I follow the Instagram project with pleasure. Speaking about the program itself, I was drawn by a full \"umbrella\" - everything is included in the subscription payments: insurance, MOT with a driver, replacement car. It is important for me to use a car and enjoy it, and not bother with its content, wait in queues at the service and fiddle with insurance. All this is covered by Drivovo. I recommend!",

We drove on empty roads, talked about cars, business model, approach to money and things. #Drivovo is an interesting service.

I am sure that Drivovo is the future of the Ukrainian car market and if you are a lazy perfectionist like me and are not ready to delve into a topic that is unnecessary for you, plus you have everything by subscription like mine, then work with Drivovo!
